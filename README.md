## Developing

### Pressmatic Addon API

This addon interfaces with Pressmatic using the [Pressmatic Addon API](https://pressmatic.gitbooks.io/addon-api/content/).

### Installing Dev Dependencies

### Folder Structure
All files in `/src` will be transpiled to `/lib` using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/). Anything in `/lib` will be overwritten.

### Transpiling
